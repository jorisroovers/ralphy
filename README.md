# Ralphy
Simple image scan organizing tool.
Mainly for personal use, no intention to make this distributable or production-quality at this point.

To get started:
```bash
cd ralphy
npm install
npm start
```

Ralphy development is just getting started. Some of the things we'd like:
- Sass
- Unit and Integration tests
- Reading tag file
- Bugfix: support slashes in tags
- Links to Google drive and local watch directory
- Autodetect tags and titles via OCR
- Notifications on new log entries
- Show which page is active in nav
